# jbmod-plugins

I originally created these plugins to prevent my server from crashing all the
time when JBMod was released, and to give players a bit more stuff
to do while hanging out in the server.

The first few weeks of JBMod have been an amazing ride, it felt like beeing
teleported back to 2005 (but this time i finally had some programming knowledge).

Thank you so much Snakez.

If you're wondering why there is no documentation - I originally never intended
to release this, but then depression kicked in and ruined my ambitions yet again.
Maybe someone else will continue this, idk,
